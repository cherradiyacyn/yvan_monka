In this repository, a collection of mini-programs in Go that i've written after having watched some videos on the Youtube channel of Mr. Yvan Monka where he explains some mathematics stuff.
At the tail of each `main.go` file, I attached the links to the videos.

## usage
```
go run 2_prime_factorization/main.go 132
```
```
go run 5_gcd_2_numbers_euclid/main.go 132 42
```
